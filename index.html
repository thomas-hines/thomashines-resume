        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Neuroscience Researcher </div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Thomas Hines is an experienced researcher from the University of California, Riverside. They have experience in systems neuroscience research specializing in fetal alcohol syndrome. Thomas’ research has landed them multiple publications across multiple literature reviews. Their most current research is centered around how consuming alcohol the night of conception affects the health and development of the fetus. Their research concluded there are in fact negative effects on the fetus if either mom or dad is drunk during conception. Thomas’ research also branches into queer theory, with their paper regarding compulsory heterosexuality and how it is sustained through social policing. 

Thomas’s extensive knowledge of both scientific and social phenomenon makes them a dynamic researcher and candidate. They also have experience as the President of The Mustard Seed Projects’ Inland Empire division. The Mustard Seed Project is a 501c3 non-profit that specializes in homeless outreach. Through The Mustard Seed Project, Thomas has completed over 200 hours of in-person outreach, making them well versed in communication, compassion, and knowledge of housing and financial systems present in the United States. Through The Mustard Seed Project, Thomas is able to build relationships with those in need, continuing support, and outreach, past the first encounter. Thomas understands the need for kindness and compassion in this world, and that realization was brought through The Mustard Seed Project. 

Thomas is also the co-founder of a non-profit, called Blossoming Minds. This non-profit organization focuses on providing supplemental education for K-12 students regarding social justice, social structures, mental health, and comprehensive sexual education. Thomas leads a team of 12 board members with their co-founder, Geethanjali. 

Three years prior, Thomas worked in a plant biology lab at UC Riverside, studying the genes of mandarin oranges, and successfully isolated the PR9 gene, which is responsible for the circadian rhythm of plants. Thomas designed their own primers to isolate the introns and exons of the genetic material, as well as completed field research picking oranges for research. Their research also was centered around isolating DNA through manipulating the medium with liquid nitrogen to crush then suspend the object’s DNA and RNA. 

Thomas also has experience in travel-based outreach. They traveled to Esteli, Nicaragua to conduct English lessons as well as complete community outreach. With this outreach, Thomas traveled to a local school and planted a garden for the children to feed themselves throughout the day. Thomas stayed in Nicaragua for a month and completed over 100 English lessons. Thomas’s students ranged from ages 10-68. This hands-on experience allowed Thomas to expand the way they communicate with others, as well as improved their communication skills in Spanish. They can now speak conversational Spanish. This experience also taught Thomas the importance of communication and teamwork. Thomas worked with multiple educators and planners to complete their projects, as well as planned budgets to complete their work. This trip gave Thomas a new perspective on the world and allowed them to always find a way to communicate compassion and care through their work. It is through all these experiences that Thomas is the person they are today.
